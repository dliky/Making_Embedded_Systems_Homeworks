# Math
 
Choose a small algorithm to implement in different ways. Describe when/why you might use
each. You can choose any small algorithm.

Some possible options include:
* How many bits are one in a given 32-bit uint?
* How many leading zeros are in a 32-bit uint?
* Trigonometry functions like sin, cos, tan
* Integer division with remainder
* Find the first 100 prime numbers

## Finding prime numbers

I compared the time and space complexity of two algorithm implementations used to search prime numbers between 1 and 100 (not exactly the problem statement but it will do I guess :sweat_smile:).

## Time Complexity, Space Complexity and Big-O Notation

Evaluating algorithms against time is not a reliable method as it is machine dependent. Instead using the [big-O notation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnRx6V8YQy0) helps the developper to determine which algorithm is faster and how time complexity varies when the number of inputs are changes(scalability).

The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. In order to calculate time complexity on an algorithm, it is assumed that a constant time c is taken to execute one operation, and then the total operations for an input length on N are calculated.
The space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. There is also auxiliary space, which is different from space complexity. The main difference is where space complexity quantifies the total space used by the algorithm, auxiliary space quantifies the extra space that is used in the algorithm apart from the given input.
