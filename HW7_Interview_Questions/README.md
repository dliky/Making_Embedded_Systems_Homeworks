# Interview Questions

## Chosen questions:

* I.15: What is a reentrant function? --> My answer was completely off-center because I confused with recursive functions :-(

* I.5: Why do we use the keyword volatile? --> My answer was quite correct (a variable that could be modified during the execution of the program).
However I didn't know that having the compiler to optimize the program could modify the variable behaviour unexpectedly.
