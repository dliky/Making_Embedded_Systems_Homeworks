# Porting a command line interface

I've spend many hours to achieve this exercise which was a "first of a kind" as far as I'm concerned. I'm not a professional programmer so I had a hard time figuring out how to deal with it.
I ported Elecia's code to a Nucleo-L476RG board using serial port #3. The serial port pins are PC10(TX) and PC11 (RX) on connector CN7. I used a USB to Serial cable to connect with a PC running a terminal emulation program. Finally, I only added one new command due to lack of time.
